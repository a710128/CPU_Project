LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell mmu_instance/J_TLB/TLB_ENTRY_LABEL[9].tlb_entry_inst/ce1_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) mmu_instance/ce1_reg/PRE, mmu_instance/ce2_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
